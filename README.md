# Audio_and-Video_Analysis
This repository contains tools and scripts for analyzing audio and video data, focusing on aspects like automatic speech recognition (ASR), digital signal processing, and other audio/video processing techniques.

# Features
Audio Analysis: Perform tasks like speech recognition, noise reduction, and audio signal processing.
Video Analysis: Process video files to detect patterns, classify content, or perform object detection.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Uses libraries and methods that are compatible across various operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

# Dependencies
Install the required libraries using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Required Packages:

opencv-python for video processing

numpy for numerical operations

pydub for audio manipulation

speech_recognition for ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)

librosa for advanced audio analysis

# Usage
Audio Analysis
The script audio_and_video_analysis.py provides various functions for audio processing. You can configure parameters for tasks like speech-to-text conversion or audio filtering by editing the relevant sections in the script.

Video Analysis
For video analysis tasks, ensure that your input files are in compatible formats (e.g., .mp4, .avi). Configure settings for tasks like frame-by-frame processing and object detection within the script.
